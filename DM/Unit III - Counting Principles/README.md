# Unit III - Counting Principles


* **Introduction:**
> * A physical process that has a number of observable outcomes.
> * For example:
> 	* Tossing a coin is an experiment & after tossing coin we will get either head or tail, these possibilities are known as outcomes.

---

* **Rule of Product:**
> * If one experiment has m possible outcomes & another experiment has n possible outcomes then there are m x n possible outcomes when both of these experiment take place.

---

* **Rule of Sum:**
> * If one experiment has m possible outcomes and another experiment has n possible outcomes then there are m + n possible outcomes when exactly one of these experiment takes place.

* **Permutation:**
> * An arrangement in a sequence of elements of a set is called permutation of the elements.
> * There are three types of arrangements:
> 	* Type I: 
>	 	 * Let 0 <= r <= n, the number of ways to have an ordered sequence of n distinct elements, taken r at a time is called as r - permutation of n elements & is denoted by p(n, r) or <sup>n</sup>P<sub>r</sub>

>               * The number of ways in which r of the n elements can be arranged where r<sub>1</sub> elements of one kind r<sub>2</sub> are of another kind and so on till r<sub>k</sub> elements are of another kind is given by

> 		* The number of permutations of n elements r at a time, when each element may be repeated once, twice, ... upto r times in any arrangement.

* **Combinations** :
> * The number of r combinations of a set with n distinct elements is denoted by C(n, r) or <sup>n</sup>C<sub>r</sub>
