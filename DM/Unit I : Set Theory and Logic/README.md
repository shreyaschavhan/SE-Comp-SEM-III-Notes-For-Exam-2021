## &#10023; Content:


* What is DM?
> * Mathematics + Computer Science Concepts


## &#10023; Set Theory:
* Set Theory:
> * Sets: 
>   * It is a collection of well defined objects.
>   * Set is usually denoted by Capital letters, A,B,C.......,Z.
>   * Elements of sets are defined by small letters, p,q,r,s,t.....

* Sets Representation:
>   * Tabular Form or Roster Form of set:
>       *  By just listing its elements 
>       * Ex. a,b,c are elements of set A : A = {a,b,c}
>   * Set Builder Form:
>       * Defined by its properties.
>       * Ex. T = {x:x is even less than 9}
>

* Types of sets:
>   * Empty set: 
>       * Contains no elements. 
>       * Also called as void set/Null set.
>       * Represented by &nbsp; ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68887544/115827188-9415c080-a429-11eb-9b89-cdcc59fb1875.png)
>   * Universal Set:
>       * If all sets are under investigation then all elements will be elements of universal set.
>       * Denoted by U 
>   * Singleton Set: 
>       * Set with only one element 
>   * Finite set:
>       * A set in which process of counting the elements can come to end. 
>       * Ex. set of all person on earth.
>   * Infinite set:
>       * A set in which process of counting does not come to end.
>       * Ex. Set of all point on an arc of circle.

* Cardinality of Sets:
>   * Cardinal numbers of a finite set: 
>       * No. of distinct elements contained in a finite set. 
>       * We can calculate Cardinality of set of only finite set.
>       * Denoted by n(S) or |S|

* Equivalent sets:
>   * Set A and B will be equivalent if their cardinality is same. i.e n(A) = n(B)
---
* Equal Set:
>   * Set A and B are said to be equal if both have same elements.
>   * Imp points:
>       * A set does not change if elements are repeated.
>       * order of elements does not matter.
> 
---
* Disjoint sets:
>   * Two sets A and B are said to be disjoint if no elements of A is in B and no elements of B is in A.
>   * Denoted by A ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68887544/115832577-ac3d0e00-a430-11eb-87cc-9556cb045be7.png) B 
---
> * Subset of a set:
>   * If every element of set A is also element fo B then set A is subset of B.
>   * Denoted by A ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68887544/115832514-9af40180-a430-11eb-826b-784ad4f7908a.png) B

> * Proper Sub Set:
>   * If A is subset of B & A ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68887544/115832577-ac3d0e00-a430-11eb-87cc-9556cb045be7.png) B then A is proper subset of B.
>   * Denoted by ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68887544/115832995-2c637380-a431-11eb-9df1-b84293df9254.png)

---
* Improper Subset:
> * If A is subset of B & A = B, then A is improper subset of B.
> * Every set is improper subset of itself.

---
* Power Set:
> * The power set of any given set A is the set of all subsets of A.
> * Denoted by P(A)
> * Cardinality: n(P(A)) = 2<sup>n</sup>

* Operations on Sets:
> * Union of Sets:
>   * Union of set A & B will be an set of all those element that belongs to A or B or both.
>   * A U B = {x:x E A or x E B}
>
> * Intersection of sets:
>   * Set of all elements that belongs to both A and B 
>   * Common element only
>   * A n B = {x:x E A and x E B}
