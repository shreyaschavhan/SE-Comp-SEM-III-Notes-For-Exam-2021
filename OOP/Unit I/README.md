# Unit I : Fundamentals of Object Oriented Programming

* ### Difference Between object oriented programming and procedure oriented programming

Sr. No|Procedure Oriented Programming | Object Oriented Programming
--- |--- | ---
1| Program is divided into small functions | Program is divided into objects
2 | More focus on function | More focus on objects
3 | Less Secure | More Secure
4 | Less maintainable | More maintainable
5 | Data members are declared globally | data members can only be accessed using function
6 | less reusability | more reusablility
7 | It uses top down approach | It uses bottom up approach
8 | It does not provide any access specifier | It has access specifiers like private, protected, public
9 | data hiding is not possible | data hiding is possible
10 | Inheritance is not possible | inheritance is possible
11 | Polymorphism, data encapsulation, data abstraction, is not possible | Possible
12 | Example , C  | example C++

### Features of OOP:

* Objects :
  * It is the basic runtime entities in OOP

* Namespaces: 
  * It is a declarative region that provides scope to the identifier
  * It is used to orgranize code into logical groups and prevent name collisions.
  * All identifiers at namespace are visible to each other without any qualifications
 
* Classes:
  * Building blocks of C++
  * User defined data type which has data, data members and member functions as its member whose access is governed by some kind of access specifier.
 
* Data members:
  * Variables declared in any class by using fundamental or derived data types are known as Data members

* Methods:
  * Functions defined in a class is called methods.
  
  
* Messages:
  * Objects communicate with each other by messaging
  * A message for object is a request for execution of a procedure and therefore will invoke a function in receiving object that generates the desired reuslt.

### Data types:

* Primitive Data Types: 
  * The data types that are inbuilt are called primitive data types
  * EX. Integers, Characters, void, boolean, wide char, float, double

* Derived data types:
  * Data types derived from primitive data types
  * Ex. functions, poijnter, array, reference

* User defined data types:
  * data types defined by users
  * ex. class, structure, enumeration, typedef defined data type , union
