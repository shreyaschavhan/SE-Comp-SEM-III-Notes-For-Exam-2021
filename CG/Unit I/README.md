# Unit I: Graphics Primitives and Scan Conversion Algorithm

## Introduction to Computer Graphics

### What is CG?
  * CG is a way of processing, generating, manipulating, storing and displaying images. 
  * Two types: 
    1. Interactive CG
        * It provides user a way to interact with the system.
        * In this type of CG, user provides an input and accordingly the output is generated.
    2. Non interactive CG 
        * Also known as passive CG.
        * User have no way to interact with the system.

  
  * Operations :
    * Geometry: how to draw and represent scene
    * Animation: how to make obects move or how to add dynamic content in the scene
    * Rendering: how to add realistic light in the scene
    * Imaging: Image acquisition and image editing 
    
### Graphic Primitives
  
  * Line : collection of points along a straight path 
  * Line Segment : It is a part of line. Curves are often represented using small line segments
  * Vector : A line represented using both direction and magnitude. 

### Basic Terminologies

* Pixel : 
  * The smallest addressable unit of an image/screen. 
  * Also known as pel or picture element.
 
 * Resolution:
    * Maximum number of pixel that can be displayed without overlap  on monitor screen.
    * Higher the resolution better the quality.
    * Number of pixel defines the actual number of samples are used from real valued scene.
 
 * Aspect ratio:
    * the ratio of number of vertical pixels to the number of horizontal pixels required to draw a line of same length in both direction is called as aspect ratio.
