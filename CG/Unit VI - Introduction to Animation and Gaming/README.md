## &#10023; Segment:
* Segment:
> * The image is divided into small substructures called segments.
> * These segments are managed using segment table.
> * i.e. Part of the display file is called as a segment.
> * Attributes like Visibility and image transformation are set for each segment.
> * Set Visibility attribute to ON, if we want to display the object, set it OFF otherwise.
