## 3D Tranformation:

* 3D
> * Dimension: defining a object in a physical spatial with minimum no. of co-ordinate is called as Dimension.
> * The number of ways in which we can move in a dimension is defined as no. of dimension.
> 	* 0D : We cannot move at all
>	* 1D : We can move in only one direction
> 	* 2D : We can move in two directions
> 	* 3D : We can move in all directions (3)

## Projections:

* Projections:
> * Projection is the process of tranforming an object representation from n-dimensional space to less than n-dimensional space.
> * projection is the process of creating image on 2D plane.
> * View Plane or Projectin Plane: Plane where object is projected.
> * Types:
> 	* Parallel Projection
> 	* Perspective Projection
> 	*  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68887544/115541681-0ddc6b80-a2bd-11eb-817a-bf3a25c5b8a3.png)

> * Rays of line is called as projector.

---

* Parallel Projection:
> * Parallel projection is achieved by passing parallel rays from the object vertices and projecting the object on view plane.
> * All projection vectors are parallel to each other.
> * It preserves true shape and size of the object on view plane.
> * It fails to capture depth information and hence cannot produce a realistic view.
> * Types:
> 	* Orthographic Parallel projection
> 	* Oblique parallel projection
> 	* ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68887544/115542078-80e5e200-a2bd-11eb-97a9-856061a94f89.png)

* Orthographic Projection:
> * Ortho means at Right angle.
> * If projectors are perpendicular to view plane, then it is called as orthographic projection.
> * Types:
> 	* Multiview: Top view, side view, bottom view, i.e we can generate multiple type of view but they can be seen in 2Dimensional view. 
> 	* Auxinomatrix: Here we can see in all 3 dimensions
> 		* Isometric = All angle equal - ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68887544/115545473-7a596980-a2c1-11eb-98bd-aaf2a8e6c933.png)
> 		* Dimetric = Two angles are not equal - ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68887544/115545762-cdcbb780-a2c1-11eb-8335-028713f54014.png)
> 		* Trimetric = Three angles are not equal. -![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68887544/115545858-eb008600-a2c1-11eb-9a1e-786287391782.png)

* Oblique parallel Projection:
> * Projectors are parallel to each other but not perpendicular to view plane.
> * Types:
> 	* Cavalier
> 		* Keep bigger face of object
> 		* Strike rays at any angle
> 		* The length of image with wide length will be same and other edge length will be proportional.
> 		 
> 	* Cabinet:
> 		* Cabinet says if the angle is 63.4<sup>0</sup> then the wide length will look 1/2.

* Perspective Projection:
> * Lines of projection i.e projectors will intersect and we can see the lines meeting at one point, this point i s called as center of projection/ projection reference point.
> * It will give us realistic views.
> * Vanishing point: Like railway track, the parallell line seems meeting at infinity, such point is called as vanishing point.
> * Vanishing point types:
> 	* 1 point : if 1 vanishing point is created then called as 1 point.
> 	* 2 point : if 2 vanishing point is created then called as 2 point.
> 	* 3 point : if 3 vanishing point is created then called as 3 point.
